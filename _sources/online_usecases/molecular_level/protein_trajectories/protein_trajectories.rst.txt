*In development*

`MoDEL_CNS <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43773/nav/301058>`_ is a platform designed to provide web-access to **atomistic-MD trajectories** for relevant **signal transduction proteins**.

The project is part of the Service for providing molecular simulation-based predictions for systems neurobiology of the **Human Brain Project**.

**MoDEL_CNS** expands the Molecular Dynamics Extended Library (MoDEL) database of atomistic Molecular Dynamics trajectories with proteins involved in **Central Nervous System** (CNS) processes, including membrane proteins.

**MoDEL_CNS web server interface** presents the resulting trajectories, analyses, and protein properties. All data produced by the project is available to download.

**MoDEL_CNS** will contribute in the improvement of the understanding of neuronal signalling cascades by protein structure-based simulations, calculating molecular flexibility and dynamics, and guiding systems level modelling.

Exploring of the data
=====================

These proteins are available to browse and filter through via the `web interface <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43773/nav/301058>`_.

Useful visualisations and statistical analyses are available to highlight different interesting aspects of these proteins within or outside of membranes.

These include a protein overview, trajectory, PCA, RMSD, and fluctuation analyses.

Programmatical access
=====================

The data can also be obtained programatically through the REST API in order to be used in scripts, or within notebooks.

The API documention is available `here <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43774/nav/301087>`_.

Such an example of use within a HBP notebook can be seen `here <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43771/nav/301045>`_.
